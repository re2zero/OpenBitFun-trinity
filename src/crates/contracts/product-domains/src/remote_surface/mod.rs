//! Product Operation Registry: the surface-neutral contract for every product
//! operation that can cross a host boundary.
//!
//! OpenBitFun has one Agent Runtime but several ways to reach it: the local Desktop
//! window, a remote SSH/Docker workspace, a Peer Device controller driving a
//! Desktop or CLI host, and detached dispatch. Each of those surfaces used to
//! keep its own hand-written table of what a command may do there (the desktop
//! remote-workspace policy table, three Peer Device deny lists, the CLI peer
//! host dispatch match, two hand-written capability objects). Nothing but
//! review kept them in agreement, and every gap became a remote-only defect.
//!
//! This module is the single owner of those facts. Hosts and generated
//! frontend artifacts derive their tables from it; contract tests prove the
//! derivations are complete. See `docs/architecture/remote-surface-contract.md`.
//!
//! The registry is behavior-light: it names operations and declares stances.
//! It does not execute anything and must not depend on any runtime crate.
