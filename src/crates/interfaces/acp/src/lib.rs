//! OpenBitFun Agent Client Protocol integration.
//!
//! This crate owns the ACP client and server surfaces over OpenBitFun's assembled
//! runtime. Product hosts select the additive `client` and `server` features
//! explicitly; the compatibility default enables both roles.

// Server prompt futures include the assembled runtime and instruction discovery.
