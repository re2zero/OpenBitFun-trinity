# OpenBitFun application brand assets

`source/openbitfun-mark.svg` is the transparent vector master for the current
fine-line Logo used by startup and in-product brand surfaces. Its fifteen rounded
hexagonal contours match the About dialog's static geometry. Motion and moving
highlights are intentionally absent from static files. The SVG uses
`currentColor`, with a light default for dark backgrounds.

The generator also maintains the existing transparent PNG paths:

- `openbitfun-mark-dark.png` is the dark mark for light surfaces.
- `openbitfun-mark-light.png` is the light mark for dark surfaces.

`source/openbitfun-app-mark.png` preserves the originally submitted silver
hexagonal application mark. Application, window, taskbar, Dock, tray, browser,
installer, and mobile launcher icons use this artwork on the black rounded-square
background with transparent corners. It is intentionally independent from the
current startup Logo, so regenerating either family cannot replace the other.
The iOS App Store icon uses an opaque black square; iOS applies the corner mask.

`exports/` contains the SVG, ICO, ICNS, and PNGs at 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96,
128, 192, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 px. Each PNG size includes a dark transparent
mark, a light transparent mark, and the application icon. Fine-line mark exports
are rendered directly from the SVG with size-specific optical treatments at
small sizes. Application icons are resized from the preserved application artwork.
Windows ICO frames, Linux icons, and macOS PNG representations use the matching
size-specific application exports. Tauri encodes the legacy 16/32 px ICNS
representations from the same artwork.

Browser entry points select explicit 16/32 px favicons. The system tray reuses
the configured application/window icon on every desktop platform.

Run `pnpm run generate-brand-assets` after changing either source master. The
generator is the single owner of the derived desktop, web, installer, Android,
iOS, and HarmonyOS files.

Verify generated dimensions, small-size rim contrast, favicon references, and
icon containers with `node --test scripts/generate-brand-assets.test.mjs`.

`source/release-letter-mascot.svg` preserves the authored character from
`openbitfun-letter.html`. Its named body, rigid head/rod, and eye parts are used
by the release letter's connected animation rig. The gradients belong to this
illustration, not to the application theme. Vite bundles this source directly;
it is independent of the application icon generator and needs no PNG export.

Verification emails use the silver application mark on its black rounded-square
background, generated at
`src/miniapp-market-web/public/assets/openbitfun-email-app-icon.png`. The market build
publishes this stable anonymous image path for email clients; it contains no
recipient or verification data and does not require authentication.

The previous email mark URL remains available for already-sent messages.
